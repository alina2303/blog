    <h2>The Purpose and Benefits of MediatR</h2>
    <p>MediatR is a powerful library that offers numerous benefits to web application developers, making it an essential
        tool in modern software development. Let's explore some of the key advantages of using MediatR in a public class
        or interface article.</p>
    <h3>Achieving Cleaner Code</h3>
    <p>One of the primary benefits of incorporating MediatR into your project is its ability to help achieve cleaner
        code. By reducing dependencies and improving maintainability, MediatR simplifies the overall codebase. With this
        simple public class library, you can eliminate tight coupling between components by decoupling the sender and
        receiver of requests, thus improving the organization and record of models.</p>
    <p>By leveraging the simple mediator pattern, MediatR allows you to send action messages between different parts of
        your application without them being explicitly aware of each other. This loose coupling promotes modularization
        and enhances code readability. As a result, maintaining and extending your codebase becomes significantly
        easier, especially when dealing with public class content.</p>
    <h3>Implementing CQRS Pattern</h3>
    <p>MediatR seamlessly enables the implementation of Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern in <a
            href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/?view=aspnetcore-7.0">ASP.NET
            Core</a> or .NET 6 applications. CQRS separates read operations (queries) from write operations (commands),
        providing a clear distinction between data retrieval and modification. With MediatR, developers can easily
        create a public class to record and order the content for CQRS implementation in their applications.</p>
    <p>With MediatR's support for CQRS, you can easily handle commands, queries, and notifications in a centralized
        manner using the public class. This approach fosters better scalability as you can optimize read-heavy or
        write-heavy scenarios independently. By segregating concerns based on intent, you can design more efficient
        systems that align with specific business requirements for the application request. Additionally, the
        FakeDataStore can be utilized to simulate data storage for testing purposes.</p>
    <h3>Centralized Message Handling</h3>
    <p>MediatR promotes a centralized approach to message handling within your application by using the public class.
        Instead of scattering command or query logic across various controllers or services, MediatR allows you to
        define handlers for each type of message in one central location, such as the FakeDataStore . This approach
        simplifies the order of handling messages and makes it easier to manage and maintain your application. So, if
        you wanna streamline your message handling process, MediatR is the way to go.</p>
    <p>This centralized message handling using the MediatR library simplifies maintenance efforts by consolidating
        related functionality into dedicated handler classes. It also enhances reusability as these handlers can be
        easily shared among different parts of your application, making it easier to order and organize your code.</p>
    <p>For example, when an order is received, MediatR automatically routes it to the appropriate handler based on its
        type. Similarly, queries can be processed by their respective handlers, ensuring consistent and efficient
        message handling throughout your application. Join us to experience this seamless order management system.</p>

    <h2>Implementing CQRS and MediatR in ASP.NET Core or .NET6</h2>
    <p>To achieve a more maintainable and scalable codebase, developers can join us in adopting the Command Query
        Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) architectural pattern. By combining CQRS with MediatR, clear separation of
        read and write operations within an application is possible. This segregation emphasizes the order of commands
        that modify data from queries that retrieve data.</p>
    <p>Join us and order MediatR, a popular open-source library in the .NET ecosystem, to simplify the implementation of
        the Mediator pattern. MediatR serves as a mediator between different parts of an application, enabling loose
        coupling and promoting better organization of code.</p>
    <p>With the MediatR library in .NET Core or .NET 6, developers can order and leverage the powerful features provided
        by these frameworks to streamline their development process.</p>
    <h3>Improved Scalability and Performance</h3>
    <p>One significant advantage of implementing CQRS with MediatR is the potential for improved scalability and
        performance. By separating read and write operations in an orderly manner, developers can optimize data access
        patterns based on specific requirements.</p>
    <p>For example, when handling write operations in order, developers can focus on ensuring consistency and
        reliability without being burdened by complex querying logic. On the other hand, read operations can be
        optimized for performance by utilizing dedicated query models tailored to specific use cases.</p>
    <p>By decoupling these concerns through CQRS and leveraging MediatR's capabilities, applications can efficiently
        scale to handle increased workloads while maintaining optimal performance levels. In other words, by
        implementing CQRS and utilizing MediatR, applications can effectively manage and process a higher volume of
        orders without sacrificing performance.</p>
    <h3>Seamless Integration with ASP.NET Core or .NET 6</h3>
    <p>ASP.NET Core and .NET 6 offer excellent support for integrating CQRS and MediatR into your application. These
        frameworks provide built-in features that streamline the adoption of these patterns without excessive
        boilerplate code. By leveraging ASP.NET Core and .NET 6, you can easily order and manage the execution of
        commands and queries in your application.</p>
    <p>To implement CQRS using MediatR in ASP.NET Core or .NET 6, follow these steps in order.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>To begin, in order to install the required packages, add the MediatR and
            <code class="language-text">MediatR.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection</code> NuGet packages to your project.</li>
        <li>Define commands and queries in order to separate the classes for commands (write operations) and queries
            (read operations). These classes should encapsulate the necessary data and logic for each operation.</li>
        <li>Implement handlers: For each command or query, create corresponding handler classes that implement the
            appropriate MediatR interfaces (<code class="language-text">IRequestHandler</code> or <code class="language-text">IRequestHandler&lt;TRequest, TResponse&gt;</code>).</li>
        <li>To ensure that MediatR can resolve the appropriate handlers when needed, register the required services
            using the built-in dependency injection container in your application's startup configuration in the
            specified order.</li>
        <li>Dispatch requests: Finally, in your application's code, use MediatR's mediator to dispatch commands or
            queries to their respective handlers.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By following these steps, you can harness the power of CQRS and MediatR within your ASP.NET Core or .NET 6
        application effortlessly.</p>

    </p>
    <p>With both the <code class="language-text">MediatR</code> and <code class="language-text">MediatR.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection</code> packages installed, you're now
        equipped with all the necessary tools to leverage MediatR effectively within your project. These packages
        provide a wide range of features, including request/response handling, query processing, notification
        broadcasting, and more.</p>
    <h2>Setting up ASP.NET Core API with MediatR for CQRS Pattern</h2>
    <p>To leverage the power of the <a
            href="https://alinabo.com/command-query-responsibility-segregation">Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)</a> pattern in your ASP.NET Core API project, you can
        integrate MediatR, a popular mediator library that simplifies communication between different components. NET
        Core API with MediatR to implement the CQRS pattern effectively.</p>
    <h3>Configuring Your ASP.NET Core API Project</h3>
    <p>The first step is to configure your ASP.NET Core API project to use the necessary services provided by the
        Mediator package through dependency injection (DI). By adding the required dependencies in your <code class="language-text">Startup.cs</code> file,
        you can ensure that MediatR is available throughout your application. This allows you to easily handle commands,
        queries, and notifications using its features.</p>
    <p>Once you have added the necessary dependencies, you need to register handlers and behaviors for commands,
        queries, and notifications within your DI container configuration. This step involves mapping each handler or
        behavior class with its corresponding interface or base class. By doing so, MediatR can identify and execute the
        appropriate logic based on incoming requests.</p>
    <h3>Properly Configuring Controllers for Mediator Pipeline</h3>
    <p>To receive requests through the mediator pipeline in your controllers, you must ensure they are properly
        configured. Start by injecting an instance of <code class="language-text">IMediator</code> into your controller's constructor.
        This provides access to all the capabilities offered by MediatR within your controller actions.</p>
    <p>With access to IMediator, you can now send commands or queries from your controllers using methods like <code class="language-text">Send()</code> or
        <code class="language-text">Publish()</code>. These methods allow you to pass requests along with any required data directly to their respective
        handlers or behaviors registered earlier.</p>
    <p>By utilizing this setup, you create a clear separation between command and query operations within your API
        project. Commands modify data while queries retrieve data without making any changes. This segregation helps
        maintain a more structured and scalable codebase.</p>
    <h3>Integrating Entity Framework Core with MediatR</h3>
    <p>If you are using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/entity-framework">Entity Framework Core</a> as your data access technology, you can seamlessly integrate it with
        MediatR. By leveraging the power of both frameworks, you can achieve a highly efficient and maintainable
        application architecture.</p>
    <p>To integrate Entity Framework Core with MediatR, create separate handler classes for each command or query that
        requires database operations. Within these handlers, utilize the appropriate methods provided by Entity
        Framework Core to interact with your database. This ensures that the CQRS pattern is followed consistently
        throughout your application.</p>
    <h2>Handling Product Commands in MediatR</h2>
    <p>Creating, updating, and deleting products are common CRUD operations in any application dealing with product
        management. In MediatR, a popular library for implementing the mediator pattern in .NET applications, handling
        these product commands is straightforward and efficient.</p>
    <h3>Command Classes for Product Operations</h3>
    <p>To handle different product-related operations, such as creating, updating, or deleting a product, we need to
        define specific command classes. These classes encapsulate the necessary data required to perform the desired
        operation. For example:</p>
    <p><pre><code class="language-csharp">
        public class CreateProductCommand : IRequest&lt;int&gt; 
        { 
            public string Name { get; set; } 
            public decimal Price {get; set; } 
            // Additional properties as needed 
        }

        public class UpdateProductCommand : IRequest&lt;bool&gt; 
        {
            public int Id { get; set; }
            public string Name { get; set; } 
            public decimal Price { get; set; } 
            // Additional properties as needed 
        
        } 
        public class DeleteProductCommand : IRequest&lt;bool&gt; 
        { 
            public int Id { get; set; } 
        }
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>By defining separate command classes for each operation, we can easily pass the required parameters and maintain
        clarity in our codebase.</p>
    <h3>Implementing Command Handlers</h3>
    <p>Once we have defined our command classes, we need to implement corresponding command handlers that contain the
        logic to execute these operations. A command handler is responsible for processing a specific type of command
        and performing the necessary actions.</p>
    <p>For instance, let's consider a <code class="language-text">PlaceOrderHandler</code> that handles the creation of a new product:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-csharp">
            public class CreateProductHandler : IRequestHandler&lt;CreateProductCommand, int&gt; 
            { 
                private readonly IProductRepository _productRepository; 
                public CreateProductHandler(IProductRepository productRepository) 
                {
                    _productRepository = productRepository; 
                    
                } 
                public async Task&lt;int&gt; Handle(CreateProductCommand request, CancellationToken cancellationToken) 
                { 
                    var newProduct = new Product { Name = request.Name, Price = request.Price}; 
                    await _productRepository.Add(newProduct); 
                    return newProduct.Id; 
                } 
            }
        </code></pre>
    <p>In this example, the <code class="language-text">CreateProductHandler</code> receives a <code class="language-text">CreateProductCommand</code> and performs the necessary steps to
        create a new product in the repository. The handler interacts with the repository, saving the newly created
        product and returning its generated identifier.</p>
    <h3>Leveraging MediatR for Command Routing</h3>
    <p>MediatR simplifies command routing by automatically directing commands to their corresponding handlers. Instead
        of manually wiring up each command with its respective handler, we can rely on <strong>MediatR's built-in
            capabilities</strong>.</p>
    <p>To send a command using MediatR, we can inject an instance of <code class="language-text">IMediator</code> into our desired class and call its
        <strong>Send method</strong>:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-csharp">
            public class ProductService 
            { 
                private readonly IMediator _mediator; 
                public ProductService(IMediator mediator) 
                { 
                    _mediator = mediator; 
                    
                } 
                public async Task&lt;int&gt; CreateProduct(string name, decimal price) 
                { 
                    var command = new CreateProductCommand { Name = name, Price = price };
                    return await _mediator.Send(command);  
                } 
            }
        </code></pre>
    <p>By utilizing MediatR's powerful routing mechanism, we can focus on defining our commands and handlers without
        worrying about manual wiring or complex routing logic.</p>
    <h2>Triggering and Testing Notifications in MediatR</h2>
    <h3>Defining Notification Classes</h3>
    <p>In MediatR, notifications are used to represent events or messages that need to be broadcasted within your
        application. These notification classes serve as a way to communicate important information to other parts of
        the system. By defining these classes, you can ensure that relevant handlers are notified whenever a specific
        event occurs.</p>
    <p>For example, let's say you have an e-commerce application and you want to send a notification whenever a new
        order is placed. You can create a <code class="language-text">NewOrderNotification</code> class that contains all the necessary information about
        the order, such as the customer details, items purchased, and total amount.</p>
    <h3>Sending Notifications with MediatR</h3>
    <p>Once you have defined your notification classes, you can use <strong>MediatR's Publish method</strong> to send
        out those notifications. This method will notify all registered handlers that are interested in those specific
        events. It acts as a central hub for broadcasting notifications throughout your application.</p>
    <p>To publish a notification using MediatR, simply call the Publish method and pass in an instance of the desired
        notification class. MediatR will then take care of notifying all relevant handlers asynchronously.</p>
    <h3>Writing Unit Tests for Notifications</h3>
    <p><strong>Testing is an essential part of software development</strong>, and it is no different when working with
        notifications in MediatR. To ensure that notifications are triggered correctly and handled by the appropriate
        handlers, it is crucial to write unit tests.</p>
    <p>When writing unit tests for notifications, there are a few key aspects to consider:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Arrange</strong>: Set up the necessary test data and dependencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Act</strong>: Trigger the event or message by publishing the corresponding notification.</li>
        <li><strong>Assert</strong>: Verify that the expected actions have been taken by checking if the appropriate
            handlers were invoked or if any side effects occurred.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By following this arrange-act-assert pattern, you can effectively test whether your notifications are being
        triggered and handled as expected.</p>
    <p>For example, in our e-commerce application scenario, you can write a unit test to ensure that the
        <code class="language-text">NewOrderNotification</code> is properly handled by the appropriate handlers. You can mock the necessary dependencies,
        publish the notification, and then assert that the expected actions were taken, such as sending an email
        confirmation to the customer or updating inventory levels.</p>
    <h2>Updating Datastore and Optimizing Data Transfer Objects with MediatR</h2>
    <h3>Using MediatR to Handle Datastore Updates</h3>
    <p>Such as a database, using a reliable and efficient tool is crucial. This is where MediatR comes into play.
        MediatR is a powerful library that allows you to handle commands responsible for updating data in your datastore
        seamlessly.</p>
    <p>With MediatR, you can define commands that encapsulate the logic required to update your data store. These
        commands can be easily executed by invoking their corresponding handlers. By utilizing this pattern, you can
        keep your code organized and maintain separation of concerns.</p>
    <p>For example, let's say you have a FakeDataStore class that simulates a database. You want to update the
        information of a specific user in this datastore. Instead of directly manipulating the FakeDataStore instance
        throughout your codebase, you can define an <code class="language-text">UpdateUserCommand</code>> that contains all the necessary information for
        updating the user's details.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-csharp">
            public class UpdateUserCommand : IRequest 
                { 
                    public int UserId { get; set; } 
                    public string NewName { get; set; } 
                    // Additional properties for other updated fields 
                }
        </code></pre>
    <p>Using MediatR, you can create an <code class="language-text">UpdateUserCommandHandler</code> that handles this command and performs the necessary
        operations on the FakeDataStore. This way, any updates related to users are centralized within this handler.</p>
    <h3>Optimizing Data Transfer Objects with AutoMapper</h3>
    <p>Optimizing data transfer objects (DTOs) is essential. DTOs act as intermediaries between your domain models and
        external systems, such as APIs or UI components. To simplify the mapping process between domain models and DTOs,
        leveraging tools like <code class="language-text">AutoMapper</code> can significantly streamline development.</p>
    <p><code class="language-text">AutoMapper</code> provides an easy-to-use mechanism for defining mappings between objects with similar properties. By
        configuring <code class="language-text">AutoMapper</code>, you can eliminate the need for manual mapping code and reduce potential errors that may
        arise during this process.</p>
    <p>For instance, let's say you have a <code class="language-text">User</code> domain model with various properties such as <code class="language-text">Id</code>, <code class="language-text">Name</code>, and <code class="language-text">Email</code>. To
        create a corresponding <code class="language-text">DTO</code>, you can define a separate class called <code class="language-text">UserDto</code> with identical properties.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-csharp">
            public class UserDto 
            { 
                public int Id { get; set; } 
                public string Name { get; set; } 
                public string Email { get; set; } 
            }
        </code></pre>
    <p>
        By utilizing <code class="language-text">AutoMapper</code>, you can easily map between the User model and the <code class="language-text">UserDto</code> without writing repetitive
        mapping code manually. This not only saves time but also reduces the chances of introducing bugs due to human
        error.
    </p>
    <h3>Validating Input Data with MediatR Validators</h3>
    <p>Ensuring proper validation of input data is crucial before performing any updates in your application. MediatR
        provides integration with validators, allowing you to validate command inputs effortlessly.</p>
    <p>By utilizing MediatR validators, you can define validation rules for your commands using attributes or custom
        validator classes. These validators automatically execute before invoking the corresponding command handler,
        ensuring that all required data is valid and meets specified criteria.</p>
    <p>For example, let's consider our previous <code class="language-text">UpdateUserCommand</code>. We want to ensure that the provided user ID is
        positive and that the new name has a minimum length of three characters.</p>
    <h2>Querying Products by ID and All Products using MediatR</h2>
    <h3>Implement query classes for retrieving products based on their unique IDs or fetching all available products.
    </h3>
    <p>When working with a complex system that involves retrieving data, it's important to have a structured approach.
        In the case of querying products, we can implement query classes that allow us to fetch specific products based
        on their unique IDs or retrieve all available products.</p>
    <p>By creating a <code class="language-text">GetProductsQuery</code> class, we can define the necessary parameters needed to retrieve specific
        products. This query class can include properties such as <code class="language-text">ProductId</code> or any other relevant identifiers. With this
        implementation, we have a clear and defined way to request specific product information.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, if we want to fetch all available products without any filters, we can create another query
        class called <code class="language-text">GetAllProductsQuery</code>. This class doesn't require any additional parameters since its purpose is to
        return all existing product data.</p>
    <h3>Develop query handlers that encapsulate the logic required to fetch the requested data from your datastore.</h3>
    <p>Once our query classes are in place, it's time to develop query handlers that encapsulate the logic needed to
        fetch the requested data from our datastore. These handlers act as intermediaries between our application and
        the underlying database or storage system.</p>
    <p>For example, when handling the <code class="language-text">GetProductsQuery</code>, we can create a corresponding handler called
        <code class="language-text">GetProductsQueryHandler</code>. Within this handler, we write code that retrieves product information based on the
        provided <code class="language-text">ID</code>. We can interact with our datastore using <strong>SQL queries</strong> or any other suitable method depending on our
        technology stack.</p>
    <p>Similarly, when dealing with the <code class="language-text">GetAllProductsQuery</code>, we create a separate handler named
        <code class="language-text">GetAllProductsQueryHandler</code>. This handler is responsible for fetching all available product data from our
        datastore without any filtering conditions.</p>
    <h3>Utilize MediatR's Send method to dispatch queries and retrieve results efficiently.</h3>
    <p>To streamline our querying process and make it more efficient, we can leverage MediatR's Send method. MediatR is
        a powerful library that helps us implement the mediator pattern in our applications.</p>
    <p>By using the Send method, we can dispatch our query objects to their corresponding handlers. MediatR takes care
        of finding the appropriate handler based on the query type and executing it. This simplifies our codebase by
        removing the need for manual handler selection and invocation.</p>
    <p>When querying products, we can utilize MediatR's Send method to dispatch both the <code class="language-text">GetProductsQuery</code> and
        <code class="language-text">GetAllProductsQuery</code>. The results are then returned back to us, allowing us to process and present the retrieved
        data efficiently.</p>
    <h2>Receiving Responses and Working with Requests in MediatR</h2>
    <h3>Handling Responses from MediatR</h3>
    <p>After executing requests through MediatR, it's essential to handle the responses returned by command or query
        handlers. These responses provide valuable information that can be further processed or used to present feedback
        to users. By effectively managing these responses, you can enhance the overall functionality and user experience
        of your application.</p>
    <p>When working with MediatR, a request/response pattern is leveraged to facilitate communication between different
        components of your application. This pattern allows for seamless interaction between various parts of the
        system, enabling efficient handling of both read operations (queries) and write operations (commands).</p>
    <h3>Extracting Relevant Information</h3>
    <p>One of the key aspects when dealing with responses in MediatR is extracting relevant information for further
        processing. Depending on the nature of your application request, this information could be critical for making
        decisions or taking appropriate actions.</p>
    <p>For example, let's consider an application where users can submit queries to retrieve specific data. When a query
        is executed through MediatR, the response returned may contain relevant details such as the requested data or
        any errors encountered during execution. By extracting this information from the response, you can process it
        accordingly and provide accurate feedback to the user.</p>
    <p>To extract relevant information from a response in MediatR:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Access the necessary properties or methods within the response object.</li>
        <li>Retrieve any required data or error messages.</li>
        <li>Store or process this extracted information as per your application's requirements.</li>
        <li>Present meaningful feedback to users based on the extracted details.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Leveraging Request/Response Patterns</h3>
    <p>MediatR offers powerful request/response patterns that streamline communication between different components
        within your application architecture. This approach promotes loose coupling and separation of concerns by
        adhering to principles like Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).</p>
    <p>By leveraging these patterns provided by MediatR:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can clearly define distinct commands and queries within your application, enhancing code organization
            and maintainability.</li>
        <li>Command handlers can focus on executing write operations without worrying about returning values, as they
            are primarily concerned with modifying the system's state.</li>
        <li>Query handlers can concentrate on retrieving data and generating responses, ensuring read operations are
            efficiently handled.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This separation of responsibilities allows for better scalability, testability, and overall system performance.
        It also simplifies future enhancements or modifications to your application by isolating specific
        functionalities within their respective handlers.</p>
    <h2>Registering and Testing Behavior with MediatR</h2>
    <p>Behaviors play a crucial role in the MediatR library, allowing developers to register specific actions that
        intercept requests before they reach their respective handlers. By incorporating behaviors into your <strong>Dependency
        Injection (DI)</strong>> container configuration, you gain the ability to implement cross-cutting concerns such as
        logging, validation, or authorization seamlessly.</p>
    <h3>Register Behaviors within Your DI Container Configuration</h3>
    <p>When working with MediatR, registering behaviors is an essential step in customizing request processing. By
        configuring your DI container to include these behaviors, you can intercept requests and perform additional
        actions before they are handled by their corresponding handlers.</p>
    <p>To register a behavior, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Define a class that implements the <code class="language-text">IPipelineBehavior&lt;TRequest,TResponse&gt;</code> interface.</li>
        <li>Implement the Handle method within your behavior class to add custom logic.</li>
        <li>Configure your DI container to include the behavior using the appropriate registration method.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For example, suppose you want to log every incoming request before it reaches its handler. You can create a
        logging behavior that writes relevant information about each request to a log file or another logging mechanism
        of your choice.</p>
    <h3>Implement Cross-Cutting Concerns with Behaviors</h3>
    <p>One of the significant advantages of using behaviors in MediatR is their ability to address cross-cutting
        concerns effectively. These concerns are aspects of an application that cut across multiple modules or layers
        and require consistent handling throughout the system.</p>
    <p>By leveraging behaviors, you can encapsulate common functionality like logging, validation, or authorization in a
        single place without scattering it across various handlers. This approach promotes code reuse and ensures that
        these concerns are consistently applied throughout your application.</p>
    <p>Consider implementing validation as a behavior within MediatR. Instead of duplicating validation logic across
        individual handlers, define a behavior that validates incoming requests based on predefined rules or business
        requirements. This approach centralizes validation logic and simplifies maintenance efforts.</p>
    <h3>Write Unit Tests for Behavior Execution</h3>
    <p>To ensure that behaviors are correctly applied and executed during request processing, it is essential to write
        comprehensive unit tests. Testing behaviors helps validate their functionality, ensuring they perform as
        expected when intercepting requests.</p>
    <p>When writing unit tests for behaviors, consider the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Test that the behavior correctly intercepts requests and performs the desired actions.</li>
        <li>Verify that the behavior does not interfere with the normal execution of handlers.</li>
        <li>Validate any modifications made by the behavior to the request or response objects.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By thoroughly testing your behaviors, you can identify and resolve any issues early on, ensuring reliable and
        predictable request processing within your application.</p>
